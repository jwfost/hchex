Hexagonal grid tool for making combinations of HCs

## Purpose
It is often useful to talk about combinations of HCs which, if leveraged together, would help someone do some task well. For this purpose, we could just list the HCs, but (a) that's not very fun; (b) it doesn't look nice; and (c) we've been able to do that for a while and nothing very interesting has happened. The purpose of the HCHex project is to provide a way for people to combine HCs in a way that is slightly more fun, prettier, and which might be used as a foundation for an HC-related game or something similar. The hexagonal tiling suggests a molecular metaphor in which meaningful collections of HCs are bound together into compounds; perhaps this can be continued at ever-higher levels of abstraction. 

## Usage
Put this on a webserver and visit index.html. Click on the names of HCs to add a hexagon tile. Drag that around. 

## Dependencies
The Javascript uses fabric.js and jquery.
